Better Than Ads Plugin Source Code
Copyright (c) 2009 Jeremy Jay <jeremy@betterthanads.com>

This is a simple site tracking plugin which can also post micropayment and
microsubscription requests to a remote server, at api.betterthanads.com.

It has been tested in FireFox and Opera in Linux and Windows.  Any browser
which supports NPAPI plugins should be able to work with it with minor changes.

Building the plugin in linux should be pretty straightforward, set up paths to
the xulrunner-sdk in config.mk and then run 'make'  To build the installation
script, cd to the installers dir, copy the plugin over, and run 'make' again.

To build in Windows, load the solution file into Visual Studio 2008 Express or
later and adjust the include paths for the xulrunner-sdk.  You can use the .nsi
script in the installers dir to build the installer as well.

Many thanks to Aplix Corp for releasing npsimple, which we used to get a
handle on the NPAPI system.  Npsimple is available at: http://git.webvm.net/
and although almost all of the npsimplecode itself is no longer used, many
of the supporting files remain as a testament to their utility.
